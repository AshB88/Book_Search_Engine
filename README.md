# Book_Search_Engine

## **Description**

The **Book Search Engine** is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite books to a personalized account. Built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, the app has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server for efficient data querying and mutation. Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their saved books seamlessly.

This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including the use of GraphQL, Apollo Client, and secure user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## **Installation**

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshB88/Book_Search_Engine.git
   cd Book_Search_Engine
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install server dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```
   - Install client dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   - **Server**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     # Use the local MongoDB URI for development
     MONGODB_URI_LOCAL='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/googlebooks'

     # Secret key for signing JSON  TokensWeb (JWT)
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

     # Node environment
     NODE_ENV=development
     ```

   - **Note**: Replace `your_jwt_secret_here` with a strong, unique secret key of your choice. This key will be used to sign and verify JWTs for user authentication.

   - **Client**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following variable:
   ```
     # GraphQL API endpoint
     VITE_GRAPHQL_URI=http://localhost:3001/graphql
     ```

4. **Start the Application**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run start
     ```
   - Start the frontend client:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.  

   - Alternatively, the application is deployed on Render and can be accessed at the following URL:  
    * https://book-search-engine-v4jk.onrender.com
